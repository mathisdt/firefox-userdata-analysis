# Firefox User-Data Analysis

I wanted to know which web sites I use the most, both from my browsing history
(which goes back to 2020 when I created the profile) and from my bookmarks.
So I wrote two small scripts which you are invited to use as well
(while complying with the GPLv3 license, of course).

## How to use

Just start any of the `analyze_*.py` scripts without parameters, it will tell you which parameter(s) it expects.
